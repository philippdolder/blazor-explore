## Table with Row and Column selection
I was struggling to build a table that allows not only row selection, but also column selection where each cell should be highlighted. So now I figured out a way to achieve exactly what I want in a simple sample. This is the cleanest approach I could find, without requiring a lot of sophistication.
This is sample code, but feel free to take the ideas and apply to your real world application.
